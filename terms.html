    <section>
      <p>Welcome to <strong>Benevest</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”). These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Benevest mobile application and related services (the “App”). By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use donation or subscription features. NGOs registering to create campaigns must be legally recognized organizations and provide accurate verification documents where requested. By creating an account you represent that you meet these requirements.</p>

    <h2>2. Accounts & Registration</h2>
    <p>To access certain features you must create an account. You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide accurate, current and complete information.</li>
      <li>Maintain and promptly update account information.</li>
      <li>Be responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including any use by others to whom you grant access.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or where we suspect fraud or misuse.</p>

    <h2>3. NGO Verification</h2>
    <p>NGOs may be required to provide verification documents (e.g., registration letters, EIN, eID). We collect and store those documents only for verification. By submitting verification documents you confirm you have the right to share them. We may refuse or remove NGO accounts that fail verification or that appear fraudulent.</p>

    <h2>4. Donations, Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
    <p>Benevest facilitates donations and subscription purchases. Payments are processed by third-party payment providers (for example, PayPal, Google Play Billing, RevenueCat). We do not collect or store full credit/debit card numbers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All donations and subscription payments are subject to the terms of the payment provider and may be irreversible.</li>
      <li>We may store transactional metadata (amount, date, campaign, receipt) for recordkeeping and legal requirements.</li>
      <li>Refunds and cancellations are governed by our <strong>refund policy</strong> (see below) and by the payment provider’s rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Campaigns & User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>NGOs create campaigns and may upload text, images, or documents (“User Content”). You retain ownership of content you post, but by posting you grant Benevest a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, display, reproduce, and distribute the content in connection with providing the App.</p>
    <p>You are solely responsible for the content you post. Prohibited content includes illegal activities, hate speech, explicit material, fraudulent claims, or copyrighted content that you do not have permission to use. We may remove content at our discretion.</p>

    <h2>6. Refunds & Disputes</h2>
    <p>Donations are generally final. Refunds are granted only at our discretion or per the payment provider's policies. For subscription cancellations, billing and refunds are handled through the relevant app store or subscription manager (e.g., Google Play / RevenueCat). Contact support for billing questions.</p>

    <h2>7. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our <a href="https://benevestx.github.io/privacy-policy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect, use, and share personal information. By using the App you agree to our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App integrates with third-party services (e.g., Firebase, PayPal, RevenueCat). These services have their own terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party actions or failures. You should review those providers’ terms.</p>

    <h2>9. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the App for unlawful or fraudulent activities;</li>
      <li>Post content that violates others’ rights or is illegal;</li>
      <li>Interfere with the App or attempt to access other accounts;</li>
      <li>Reverse-engineer or attempt to copy the App’s code or services;</li>
      <li>Attempt to circumvent payment processes or verification steps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Termination & Suspension</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access for violations of these Terms, suspected fraud, legal reasons, or inactivity. Termination does not limit other remedies available to us under law.</p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The App is provided “as is” and “as available.” We expressly disclaim all warranties to the fullest extent permitted by law, including fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and uninterrupted service. We do not guarantee results from donations or NGO activity.</p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Benevest and its affiliates will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of your use of the App. Our aggregate liability for direct damages will not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid to us in the last 12 months, or (b) USD $100.</p>

    <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Benevest and its officers, agents and employees harmless from any claims, damages, liabilities, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of your violation of these Terms or your misuse of the App.</p>

    <h2>14. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All Benevest trademarks, logos, and content are our property. You may not use our intellectual property without prior written permission.</p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>United States</strong> without regard to conflict of law principles. For disputes, you agree to seek resolution first by contacting support at <a href="mailto:help.benevest@gmail.com">help.benevest@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>16. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms. Material changes will be posted with an updated effective date. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
